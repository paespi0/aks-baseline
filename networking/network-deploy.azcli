# The networking team has all their regional networking hubs in the following resource group

# and all of their regional spokes in the following resource group.
az group create --name rg-enterprise-networking-spokes --location eastus

# When they created the hub for eastus2, it didn't have any spokes yet defined, yet the networking
# team always lays out a base hub pattern. A hub always contains an Azure Firewall (with some org-wide
# policies), Azure Bastion, a gateway subnet for on-prem connectivity, and Azure Monitor for network
# observability.  They follow Microsoft's recommended sizing for the subnets.
#
# The networking team has decided that 10.200.[0-9].0 will be where regional hubs are homed
# on their organization's network space.
#
# Note: Azure Bastion and the On-Prem Connectivity is not actually deployed in this sample, just
# the subnets for them are.
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-enterprise-networking-hubs --template-file hub-default.json --parameters location=eastus2

# In addition to the eastus2 regional hub (shown above) you can assume there are similar deployed as well in
# in other Azure regions.

# The hub creation will emit the following:
# * hubVnetId - which the network team will need to know for future spokes that get created
#             - E.g. /subscriptions/[subsubcription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-hubs/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-eastus2-hub

# The networking team receives a request from an app team in business unit (BU) 0001 for a network
# spoke to house their new AKS-based application (Internally know as Application ID: A0008).  The 
# network team talks with the app team to understand their requirements and aligns those needs with
# Microsoft's best practices for a secure AKS cluster deployment.  They capture those specific
# requirements and deploy the spoke, aligning those specs; connecting it to the matching regional hub.
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-enterprise-networking-spokes --template-file spoke-BU0001A0008.json --parameters hubVnetLocation=eastus2 hubVnetId="/subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-hubs/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-eastus2-hub"

# The spoke creation will emit the following:
# * userNodepoolSubnetResourceIds - An array containing the subnet Ids for the AKS user nodepools in the spoke
#           - E.g. ["/subscriptions/[subsubcription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00/subnets/snet-user-clusternodes"]
# * systemNodepoolSubnetResourceIds - An array containing the subnet Ids of the AKS system nodepools in the spoke
#           - E.g. ["/subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00/subnets/snet-system-clusternodes"]
# * clusterVnetResourceId - The Resource ID of the vnet that the cluster will land in
#           - E.g. /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00

# Now that their hub has a spoke and can no longer run off of the generic hub template, the networking
# team creates a named hub template to forever represent this specific hub and the features this specific
# hub needs in order to support its unique spokes' requirements.  As new spokes are attached and new
# requirements arise for the regional hub, they will be added to this master template file.
az deployment group create --resource-group rg-enterprise-networking-hubs --template-file hub-regionA.json --parameters location=eastus2 nodepoolSubnetResourceIds="['/subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00/subnets/snet-system-clusternodes', '/subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourceGroups/rg-enterprise-networking-spokes/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-hub-spoke-BU0001A0008-00/subnets/snet-user-clusternodes']"

# At this point the networking team has delivered a spoke in which BU 0001's app team can lay down
# their AKS cluster (ID: A0008).  The networking team provides the necessary information to the app team
# for them to reference in their Infrastructure-as-Code artifacts.

# Note: Hubs and Spokes are controlled by the Networking Team's GitHub actions pipelines.  This automation 
# is not included in this sample as this sample is mostly focused on the AKS baseline and not the networking
# team's CI/CD practices.
